## Hello, there!

I’m Andrei Varabyeu. I’m a Java Backend Developer and Test Automation Engineer from Minsk, Belarus. I've been working in one of the biggest outsourcing companies in Eastern Europe.

In my spare time I like to explore new APIs and libraries and push some shit into GitHub.

I’m constantly seeking opportunities that put my development skills to use. [Get in touch.](mailto:andrei.varabyeu@gmail.com)
